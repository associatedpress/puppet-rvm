Puppet module to install rvm in a per user basis
=========================================================================
For an isolated install within a user's $HOME, not for root. Recomended by
wayneeseguin in https://rvm.io/rvm/install

Not really tested so far. For me it works in ubuntu 12.04LTS. Used in puppet 2.7 but it should also work in recent versions

If you are planning of using this for a ruby on rails with capistrano probably will be a better idea to use the [rvm/capistrano](http://rvm.io/integration/capistrano)
plugin along capistrano

Install rvm in jhondoe user
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It won't install any ruby, just rvm.
NOTE: User jhondoe will be created if doesn't exist
```ruby
rvm::rvmuser{"jhondoe":} # Install stable version of rvm for the user jhondoe, creates user if inexistent
```

Install rvm in jhondoe user and also install ruby version 2.0.0-head
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing and compilling any ruby version can take a while (>400seconds?)
The ruby version will be the default for this user
```ruby
rvm::rvmuser{"jhondoe":
  installdefaultruby => "2.0.0-head", # Optional Indicates the version that will be
     #installed. Find available ruby versions with $rvm list known
  homeuser => "/home/jhondoe", #defaults to /home/jhondoe(If jhondoe is the provided user)
} 
```

Install ruby version 2.0.0-head and make it as default ruby version
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```ruby
rvm::installruby{"install-ruby-to-jhondoe":
  user => 'jhondoe', #required
  rubyversion => "2.0.0-head", #required
  makedefault => true, #defaults to false
  homeuser = "/home/jhondoe", # Optional, defaults to /home/$user
}
```

Create a new gemset called gemsetname
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```ruby
rvm::creategemset{"gemsetname":
  user => "jhondoe", # user param is required
  rubyversion => "2.0.0", # Ruby version is required
  homeuser = "/home/jhondoe", # Optional, defaults to /home/$user
} 
```
Remember that a gemset is usually used to switch to a ruby
version and a set of gems. In a directory, if you write a file called .ruby-gemset with
the content "gemsetname" and a file called .ruby-version with the content
"ruby-1.9.3-p374" rvm will automatically switch to that ruby version with
the gemset called 'gemsetname' when you enter in that dir.
